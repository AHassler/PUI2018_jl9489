This homework was a collaboration between Jerome Louison (jl9489) and Andrea Hassler (ah4412).

Most of the code was done separately, with some back and forth discussion about select sections.  
The code I borrowed the most was the algorithm determining the distance between Citibike stations and Times Square.
